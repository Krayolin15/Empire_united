# ⚽ EMPIRE UNITED | THE ELITE

**A high-performance digital experience for Empire United FC.**

## 💎 The Vision

Empire United is more than a soccer club; it is an elite sporting organization. This project was commissioned to translate the club's "Forged in Excellence" philosophy into a premium digital presence. Developed via **NextWave Web**, the site focuses on high-end motion design, immersive user experience (UX), and mobile-first accessibility.

### 2. Advanced UX/UI

* **Dynamic Gallery:** An intelligently handled media grid supporting both high-resolution imagery and auto-playing video highlights.

### 3. Technical Performance
